  A Simple, hassle free, Slack integration, offering a better experience than the official plugin.
  This code makes use of some of the official plugin, but under the hood, it runs a workflow monitoring job,
  which allows it to trigger a simple pass or fail status message at the end of your workflow, as well as adding and updating status messages.
  Simply Add the invluded workflow to your project, and configure the following environment
  variables, and you will receive Slack notifications containing useful test result information
  including a random giphy image whenever tests enter, or leave a known state.

  e.g. a Build is broken for the first time, or a build is fixed.

  You will need the following environment variables configured
     * CIRCLE_TOKEN
     * GIPHY_TOKEN
     * SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN

  Configure the SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN in the same way as described by the official slack plugin circleci/slack

  New Feature Added, For creating and updating status notifications. E.g. When the process starts, post a message to a
  status channel, and then update it if the overall workflow status is a pass or fail.

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
display:
  home_url: "https://github.com/martyzz1/slack-notifier"
  source_url: "https://github.com/martyzz1/slack-notifier"

# If your orb requires other orbs, you can import them like this. Otherwise remove the "orbs" stanza.

#  hello: circleci/hello-build@0.0.5
