  A Simple, hassle free, drop in replacement for the old Legacy Slack integration.
  Simply Add the invluded workflow to your project, and configure the following environment
  variables, and you will receive Slack notifications containing useful test result information
  including a random giphy image whenever tests enter, or leave a known state.

  e.g. a Build is broken for the first time, or a build is fixed.

  You will need the following environment variables configured
     * CIRCLE_TOKEN
     * GIPHY_TOKEN
     * SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN

  Configure the SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN in the same way as described by the official slack plugin

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
display:
  home_url: "https://github.com/martyzz1/slack-notifier"
  source_url: "https://github.com/martyzz1/slack-notifier"

# If your orb requires other orbs, you can import them like this. Otherwise remove the "orbs" stanza.
# orbs:
#  hello: circleci/hello-build@0.0.5
