  Simply Add the invluded workflow to yoour project, and configure the following environment
  variables, and you will receive Slack notifications containing useful test result information
  including a random giphy image whenever tests enter, or leave a known state.

  e.g. a Build is broken for the first time, or a build is fixed.

  You will need the following environment variables configured
     * CIRCLECI_TOKEN
     * GIPHY_TOKEN
     * SLACK_WEBHOOK

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
display:
  home_url: "https://github.com/martyzz1/circleci-slack-notifier"
  source_url: "https://github.com/martyzz1/circleci-slack-notifier"

# If your orb requires other orbs, you can import them like this. Otherwise remove the "orbs" stanza.
# orbs:
#  hello: circleci/hello-build@0.0.5
